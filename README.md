# Firefox Responsive Design Mode presets
Ready to go Firefox responsive design mode presets in JSON format.

# How to use:
- Open __about:config__
- Search for __devtools.responsiveUI.presets__
- Replace the value of the key with [presets.json](https://github.com/dehghani-mehdi/firefox-responsive-design-mode-presets/blob/master/presets.json) file's content


The list provided using [Media Queries for Standard Devices](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/media-queries-for-standard-devices/) and some other articles.

## Update
This solution doesn't work on Firefox in 51 & above! for now you could change the pref "devtools.devices.url" to point at your own JSON file.
